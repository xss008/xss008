Hello everyone, I am a student who is learning programming. I am very interested in computer science and programming, and I have been working hard to improve my skills. I enjoy challenging myself, solving problems, and creating useful things. Through my studies, I have learned various programming languages and tools, including Java, Python, and Git. I also like to collaborate with others to solve problems through brainstorming. I am currently working hard to learn more skills and hope to become an excellent programmer in the future.
